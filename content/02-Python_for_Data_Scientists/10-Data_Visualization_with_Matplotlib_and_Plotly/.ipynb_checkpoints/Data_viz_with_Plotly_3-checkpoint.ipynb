    "## 3D plots\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the very interesting and advanced features of plotly is to render 3D plots. Interactive 3D plots can enable multi-dimensional visualization and pattern recognition and learning in a whole new perspective. Two of the 3D plots that we would learn in this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3D Scatter plots\n",
    "* 3D Surface plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that though 3D plots are extremely powerful visualization plots, they are to be appropriately applied on suitable data, else the interpretability of the visualization may become too difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3D Scatter plot\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3D scatter plot is a visualization for a set of observations which have 3 features - x,y and z. A 3D scatter plot can be created much like any other plot, by defining a trace, data and layout and using them to create the figure object. While creating the trace, we must use the Scatter3d method from graph objects module in order to create our 3D plot.\n",
